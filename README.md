### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This exists to collate and link to the resources for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

It may be disbanded and moved to a more generalised resource for the new Raspberry Pi line of microcontrollers, but for now this resource also includes the RP2040.

The wiki is open to anyone to edit - please create pages as appropriate but someone may come along to move things around and/or delete blatent sales pitches without substances.

May the source be with you.
